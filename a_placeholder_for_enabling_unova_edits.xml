<!-- If you remove this file, you will load over 48,000 lines of incorrect dialog.
The game will revert to using the internal dump version of files when reimporting Unova strings.
That means if you have any string that edits region_id="2" on your system- all MMO specific dialog is not being displayed. 
You may repurpose this file for your own use if you wish, however- please credit nurver, realmadrid1809 and AnonymousPoke. -->
